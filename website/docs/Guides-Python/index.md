# Welcome to LionWeb Python

LionWeb Python is a Python implementation of the LionWeb specification, providing libraries for working with languages and models in the LionWeb ecosystem.

If you are instead using [Java](/Guides-Java/), [Kotlin](/Guides-Kotlin), [Javascript, Typescript](/Guides-Typescript), or [C#](/Guides/Csharp) please look for the corresponding bindings.

## What is LionWeb?
