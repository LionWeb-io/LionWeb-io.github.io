# Status and Roadmap

The project currently support the core specifications.

It may be requiring some refining, and completing the repo client to support more rarely used APIs.

LionWeb Python supports serialization to protobuffer and the LionWeb Archive.

It also supports the generation of classes from a LionWeb language.

The delta protocol is not yet supported.

Once that is done, We will then proceed to review the project, performing some general maintenance and release version 1.0.
