[Join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lionweb/shared_invite/zt-1zltq8eqv-QJmtsZA8_oscCrO8HOp3FA) for interesting discussions.

## Activities

1. The main focus is the definition of protocols for the communication between
   participating software components such as repositories and clients. To make
   this feasible, we also define a meta-metamodel as well as a reference architecture.

2. Where appropriate, in order to support the protocols, LionWeb defines
   programming language-level APIs to access models and metamodels and to
   encapsulate the protocols.

3. A third activity is to create a collaboration hub for the developers of such
   components, to empower other software developers to develop web-based modeling
   solutions, and to educate the public about the benefits of this approach.


## Work Products

We aim to create the following work products (in order of descending priority):

* [Document] Specifications for the communication protocols; this also requires the definition of a meta-metamodel
* [Document] A reference architecture for cloud-based modeling tools (necessarily mainly to be able to produce the others)
* [Code] Where appropriate, bindings for these protocols in several programming languages
* [Code] Reference implementations and examples of how to build systems using the LionWeb protocols (in particular, using some of the systems mentioned in the History section)

In terms of how we work, we aim for a collegial atmosphere and effective technical discussions. All our specifications will be backed by working code (OMG, this is really nice!).

This project will not provide production-quality implementations for the repositories or clients; we expect this to be done by the community, for example, based on the tools mentioned in the History section.
