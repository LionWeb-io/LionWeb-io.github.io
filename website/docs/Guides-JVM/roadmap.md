# Status and Roadmap

The project currently support the core specifications.

We released version 1.3 in early 2026.
We have recently merged *LionWeb-Java* and *LionWeb-Kotlin* in **LionWeb-JVM**.

The library is mature with great support for serialization, language definition, nodes manipulation, code generation, and the LionWeb Archive format.

We are progressing on:
- Completing support for the Delta protocol
- Solve any issue reported
- Constantly optimize performance

The project is used in production and actively maintained.
